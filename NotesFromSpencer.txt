After I successfully got the update things look better.

Here's some task you might be able to complete for the final version

- Enhance the UI to show more than one symbol at a time. The use of JList or JTable might be useful.
Use an Add button to prompt the user for additional symbols

- Automatically save stock symbols so when the app starts it automatically displays previous entries.
The JDK's preferences class might be handy here.

- History
Show the stocks hi and low prices for a given period of time.
That period of time can be pre-set like 1 day , 1 week, 6 months and 1 year
>> DONE: I added in 52 week high & low to end of the string

You don't have to do all of these things but try to do some of them.

also, under src create a new directory called test >> DONE
in test create a new directory called java >> DONE
under java create a directory structure that matches the directories under main/java >> DONE
(these directories are your packages) >> DONE
Put your test code in these directories. >> DONE
Test code goes in the same package as the src code, but under /test/java not /main/java >> DONE
Does this make sense? >> DONE



What kind of problems are you having with packages? >> DONE; Not sure, seems to work now.
Packages are just directories on the file system. >> DONE

In your code:
the first line of the Java class is the package statement.
When classes use code from classes in other packages, the import statement is used.
I will commit an example of this.
Do you know how packages relate to the classpath?

Using JavaDoc is really simple! There is not much to teach here. I also assumed anyone in advance class
would know how to do JavaDoc already or be able to quickly pick it up on their own. That said here are some quick
getting started tips:

You start comments with /**
You use various tags to denote different types of data.
e.g
@author

Idea even generates the tag when you type
/**

at the start of a method or class.

------------------------------------------------------

Usually I name test classes like this:

StockTest rather than TestStock
>> I actually thought I read in the notes you wanted Test at the end.  I re-read the week 2 notes
>> and found you wanted StockTest or better StockJUnitTest.  I've renamed my test classes to
>> StockJUnitTest & GetStockQuoteJUnitTest.

I liked that your Stock class had 100% coverage but you need to write more tests for the other classes.
>> I'll take another look at this.  I'm not actually sure I know how to test the other classes.  If
>> I can't figure it out, I'll need some help.  If you prefer, if I can't figure it out you can just
>> show me when I turn it in.  But if you go that route please SHOW me some tests, don't just say
>> you should have tested more.

you need to use packages to separate your code better.
>> On 10/13 I sent you an email saying I was having problems with this.  You didn't address it in
>> your response to my email.

Unless I am missing something I don't see any price or stock info in the UI yet.
>> If you put GOOG into the left box and click get price, it outputs "GOOG","Google Inc.",675.15,"10/26/2012","4:00pm"
>> If you put AAPL into the left box and click get price, it outputs, "AAPL","Apple Inc.",604.00,"10/26/2012","4:00pm"
>> I'm not sure why you aren't able to see it.  I've both commited AND pushed.

You need to document your code better.
>> I'll take a look at this.  No one, including you, has ever taught me how to use JavaDoc.  I've
>> done my best to figure it out by reading online, but if I'm missing stuff it's because I don't
>> know how to do it & I'm doing it blindly.  So again, this may be to be something you grade me
>> down on - which is OK.  I just ask that when you grade me down, you ALSO give me good examples
>> of what you wanted so I'll know what's expected not just in this class - but in the world.

What is your plan for completing this work?
1. I've renamed the test-classes as requested.
2. I'll look at writing more tests, but I'm reasonably sure if I haven't written a test for a method
   it's because I don't know how to.
3. I asked for help on packages on 10/13.  If you want me to use them, please help
4. UI works on my computer, I don't know why it doesn't work for you.
5. Apparently my attempt to teach myself to write JavaDoc has not worked.  I don't know what else
   to say about my documentation.  It's the best documentation I've ever done in any class.
