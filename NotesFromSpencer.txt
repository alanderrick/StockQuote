Usually I name test classes like this:

StockTest rather than TestStock

I liked that your Stock class had 100% coverage but you need to write more tests for the other classes.

you need to use packages to separate your code better.

Unless I am missing something I don't see any price or stock info in the UI yet.

You need to document your code better.

What is your plan for completing this work?
