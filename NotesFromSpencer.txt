Usually I name test classes like this:

StockTest rather than TestStock
>> I actually thought I read in the notes you wanted Test at the end.  I re-read the week 2 notes
>> and found you wanted StockTest or better StockJUnitTest.  I've renamed my test classes to
>> StockJUnitTest & GetStockQuoteJUnitTest.

I liked that your Stock class had 100% coverage but you need to write more tests for the other classes.
>> I'll take another look at this.  I'm not actually sure I know how to test the other classes.  If
>> I can't figure it out, I'll need some help.  If you prefer, if I can't figure it out you can just
>> show me when I turn it in.  But if you go that route please SHOW me some tests, don't just say
>> you should have tested more.

you need to use packages to separate your code better.
>> On 10/13 I sent you an email saying I was having problems with this.  You didn't address it in

Unless I am missing something I don't see any price or stock info in the UI yet.
>> If you put GOOG into the left box and click get price, it outputs "GOOG","Google Inc.",675.15,"10/26/2012","4:00pm"
>> If you put AAPL into the left box and click get price, it outputs, "AAPL","Apple Inc.",604.00,"10/26/2012","4:00pm"
>> I'm not sure why you aren't able to see it.  I've both commited AND pushed.

You need to document your code better.
>> I'll take a look at this.  No one, including you, has ever taught me how to use JavaDoc.  I've

>> down on - which is OK.  I just ask that when you grade me down, you ALSO give me good examples
>> of what you wanted so I'll know what's expected not just in this class - but in the world.

What is your plan for completing this work?
1. I've renamed the test-classes as requested.
2. I'll look at writing more tests, but I'm reasonably sure if I haven't written a test for a method
   it's because I don't know how to.
3. I asked for help on packages on 10/13.  If you want me to use them, please help
4. UI works on my computer, I don't know why it doesn't work for you.
5. Apparently my attempt to teach myself to write JavaDoc has not worked.  I don't know what else
   to say about my documentation.  It's the best documentation I've ever done in any class.
